CSS Cascading Style Sheets 

every browser has a default stylesheet 

block styling 

-> style html pages
-> responsive design 
-> maintain a brand identity

CSS is not a programming language -> style sheet language 


selector {
    property:value;
}

.main -> we use . for class
#1 -> # for id
h1-> named tags (element selector)
* -> universal selector
